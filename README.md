# rudakeest
## a poetry animation service, available at https://volb.space/rudakeest/

This is a React single page application intended to automate and simplify the process of presenting a piece of text to a group in a slideshow format. This will be most useful for poetry seminars, when you need to show a verse and its translation to a group of people. The project is named after Rudaki, the first poet to write in modern Persian. The "eest" at the end is a stylistic flair that is also a pun in Persian, which makes the name mean "it is Rudaki" as well as "Who is Ruda?".
